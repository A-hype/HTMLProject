        <b>Vegetable Pakora Recipe</b> <br>
        
        1. Prepare Vegetables: Grate or chop 1 large potato, 1 small carrot, 1/2 cup cauliflower florets, and a handful of spinach leaves. You can also add peas, beans, or any other veggies you like.
        2. Make the Batter: In a large mixing bowl, add 1 cup besan (gram flour), 2 tbsp rice flour (optional, for crispiness), 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, 1 tsp red chili powder, 1 tsp garam masala, and salt to taste.
        3. Add Seasonings: Add 1/2 tsp ajwain (carom seeds), 1/2 tsp cumin seeds, and 1-2 chopped green chilies. 
        4. Prepare the Batter: Gradually add water, mixing continuously, until the batter is thick enough to coat the vegetables, but not runny.
        5. Add Vegetables: Add the grated and chopped vegetables to the batter, and mix until they are evenly coated.
        6. Optional Additions: For extra flavor, add finely chopped ginger, garlic, and fresh coriander leaves to the mixture.
        7. Heat Oil: In a deep frying pan, heat enough oil to submerge the pakoras over medium heat.
        8. Test Oil Temperature: Drop a small piece of batter into the oil; if it rises immediately, the oil is ready.
        9. Fry Pakoras: Carefully drop spoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. 
        10. Fry Until Golden: Fry the pakoras for 4-5 minutes, turning them occasionally, until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides.
        11. Drain Excess Oil: Remove the pakoras from the oil and place them on a paper towel to drain excess oil.
        12. Prepare Chutney: Serve the pakoras with a side of tangy tamarind chutney or fresh mint-coriander chutney.
        13. Serving Suggestion: Serve the pakoras with sliced onions and lemon wedges for added freshness.
        14. Enjoy with Tea: These pakoras make a perfect accompaniment to a hot cup of chai or any beverage of your choice.
        15. Spicy Variation: Add a pinch of chat masala or black salt to the pakoras for extra spice.
        16. Customize Veggies: You can add other vegetables like zucchini, sweet potatoes, or mushrooms for variety.
        17. Gluten-Free Option: Use rice flour or corn flour instead of besan for a gluten-free version.
        18. Crispy Texture: Ensure the batter is thick enough to give a crispy texture, but not too thick to make the pakoras doughy.
        19. Serve Warm: Pakoras taste best when served immediately after frying while they're hot and crispy.
        20. Storage: Leftover pakoras can be stored in an airtight container for a day or two, though they may lose their crispness.
        
        Enjoy your crunchy, savory vegetable pakoras!</p>
